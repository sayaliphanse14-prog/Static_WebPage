A static web page is a type of website that displays fixed content to every visitor. 
The content does not change dynamically and is delivered to the user exactly as stored on the server. 
These pages are usually built using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript.

Key Features:
Simple and fast to load
Same content for all users
Easy to develop and host
Best for small websites, portfolios, landing pages, or documentation
Unlike dynamic web pages, static pages do not use databases or server-side processing. 
Any change in content must be done by directly editing the HTML/CSS files.
